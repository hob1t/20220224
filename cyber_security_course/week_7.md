Introduction to Cyber Forensics

Cyber forensics is popularly known as digital forensics or computer forensics. The method of solving crimes committed using some form of electronic devices (such as computers, servers, printers, mobile phones, tablets, portable cameras, networking systems, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, or any kind of data storage device) is known as cyber forensics. Cyber forensics is now in charge of investigating cyber-attacks such as malware, phishing, SQL injection attacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, data breaches, among other cyber-attacks that result in financial or reputational losses. A cyber forensics investigation's primary objective is to store, locate, obtain, and record digital information to be used in court.

#### Process of Forensics Investigation

Investigating a crime scene is hard work. The way the police handle a robbery scene differs from the way they handle a crime scene. The place of the crime whether indoors, outdoors, or in a vehicle, has its considerations. The police have a process of investigating the crime scene. No matter where or when the crime occurred, the investigative process at the scene of a crime remains nearly the same.

Similarly, in digital forensics, cyber experts go through an investigation process. Let us watch the video to understand the process better.

#### Forensic Imaging

Protecting the original data in compliance with industry guidelines and digital forensics best practices is the first step in any digital forensics investigation. This is accomplished by the creation of a forensic picture of the actual proof object.

A forensic image is a detailed first-hand copy of any computer storage device, files, folders, and various unallocated spaces with the operating system. Forensic images include not only the visible files in the operating system but also the deleted files and other pieces of evidence left in the free spaces.

####Anti-Forensics Techniques & Detection

Anti-forensics (AF) tools disrupt Computer Forensic Tools (CFTs) by deleting or altering data by hiding appropriate details.  Most of the Anti-forensic tools used are directly against digital forensics that is used for overwriting information and leaving footprints on the suspected system. Such footprints eventually become more challenging during forensic analysis. Thus, leaving the “tracer” data leading to CFTs being unreliable.
