Web Server Overview

A web server is a program that manages the hosting of websites. It’s computer software that requisitions web pages and distributes them as needed. The web server's primary goal is to store, 
process, and distribute web pages to customers. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used for this intercommunication (HTTP). The majority of the material on these web pages is static, such as HTML 
documents, photos, style sheets, and tests.

A web server supports the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and FTP (Information Transfer Protocol) protocols for email, file transfer, and caching, in addition to HTTP.
