Introduction to Firewall

As the name suggests, a firewall serves to protect communication between two networks. A firewall may be set up as a standalone hardware system, as software on a client computer, or in a proxy 
server. The hardware and software firewalls are the two kinds of firewalls. A firewall that remains between two networks inspects a packet that is about to be sent between them and decides whether 
to allow or block it based on the firewall's rules.

As such, a firewall is a protection layer between network architecture with the following aims:

    Establish a controlled link
    Protect the premises network from Internet-based attacks
    Provide a single choke point
