#### Introduction to Wi-Fi network and Android Pentesting

Wi-Fi helps computers and digital networks to communicate without the use of cables. When Wi-Fi-compatible computers are in the range of a Wi-Fi network, 
data is transmitted over radio waves, enabling them to receive and send data. Penetration monitoring for mobile devices is a specialized service that 
can be used to verify the security controls on mobile apps. The word "pentest" emerges from the word penetration test. As mobile applications are 
widely utilized in all fields of activity, they become more appealing to malicious attackers. Apps and websites must thus have good security. 
As a result, we conduct mobile app penetration testing that takes their unique characteristics into account.

A penetration test can assist in identifying a system's attack weaknesses and determine how vulnerable the attack is. This can also be useful 
while documenting the penetration test reports. Thus, the penetration test reports can be used to assess the potential impact on an institution 
by suggesting countermeasures to narrow down the security risk.
