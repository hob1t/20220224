### Introduction to Darknet and Deep Web

For most of us, the Internet is limited to 15-20 or perhaps 40 websites. The majority of this limited collection consists of Google sites and services. The Internet is huge, and it has about a billion existing websites on servers worldwide. Even with these billions of sites, the Internet is incomplete. Many people think the global network we're seeing is just the peak of an iceberg. Darknet and Deep Web somehow explain the presence of this hidden web that most people are unaware of. And those who are familiar with the darknet often mistake it for a deep web. Whereas the two are entirely different.

The word "Darknet" is often used interchangeably with "dark web" due to the number of services hidden on Tor’s Darknet. Darknet is an encrypted network constructed on top of the available internet, and particular software or tools are necessary to access the Darknet. Conventional protocols used on the Internet may not work on the Darknet. Darknet provides secrecy to the users. Such a Darknet is either Tor or onion router. You need the Tor browser to get into Tor’s network. The deep web refers to the kind of Internet not completely accessible via typical search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. The Deep Web consists of pages that were not listed, paid websites, private databases, and the Dark Web.
