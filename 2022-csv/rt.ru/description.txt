Rostelecom is Russia's largest provider of digital services for a wide variety of consumers, households, private businesses, government and municipal authorities, and 
other telecom providers. Rostelecom interconnects all local public operators' networks into a single national network for long-distance service. In other words, if 
one makes a long-distance call or originates Internet contact to or from Russia, it is likely that Rostelecom is providing part of the service. The company's stock 
trades primarily on the Moscow Exchange.
